    <p>We’ve innovated our way out of previous traps</p>
    <p>
      Brett: If you’re an academic, being able to explain all of the problems
      that are out there and how dangerous these problems are and why you need
      funding to look at them in more depth appears to be the intellectually
      serious position; whereas, someone who claims that we can solve it sounds
      a little bit kumbaya.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, collaboration, cooperation and resource exploitation are the
      things that will drive this knowledge economy forward so that we can solve
      these problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      It always seems more intellectually serious if you can stand out there
      with a frown on your face in front of a TED Talk audience and say, “These
      are all the ways in which we’re going to die, in which the Earth is going
      to fail, and in which we’re going to come to ruin.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Naval: I’m guilty of having recorded one of these doomsayer podcasts about
      enders blowing up the Earth. That was the one podcast I regretted the
      most. We had a great conversation, but I don’t fundamentally agree with
      conclusions that we should slow down because the world is going to end.
    </p>
    <p>The only way out is through progress.</p>
    <p>
      I haven’t promoted that podcast as much as others. When I read Deutsch, I
      realized why: Pessimism is an easy trap to fall into, but it implies that
      humans are not creative. Pessimism doesn’t acknowledge all the ways that
      we have innovated our way out of previous traps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Entrepreneurs are inherently optimistic because they get rewarded for
      being optimistic. As you were saying, intellectuals get rewarded for being
      pessimistic. So there is incentive bias.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you’re a pessimist, you get your feedback from other people. It’s a
      social act. You’re convincing other people of your pessimism. But
      entrepreneurs get feedback from nature and free markets, which I believe
      are much more realistic feedback mechanisms.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far, most of the pessimistic predictions have turned out to be false.
      If you look at the timelines on which the world was supposed to end or
      environmental catastrophes were supposed to happen, they’ve been quite
      wrong.
