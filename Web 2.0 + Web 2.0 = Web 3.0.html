      That’s right, Vast.com is moving! If you have a Web 2.0 company somewhere
      in SOMA or Mission and would like to sublease about 2000-3000 square feet
      of space, please contact me at [myfirstname]@[mylastname].[com]. We’d
      prefer something well lit, near to shops / restaurants, etc., and
      populated with interesting people.
