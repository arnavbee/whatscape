      I like Venture Capital. I really do. And even in the current bubble,
      <a
        href="http://www.dilbert.com/comics/dilbert/archive/images/dilbert2005152631215.gif"
        >Vijay, the World’s Most Desperate Venture Capitalist</a
      >
      is a little exaggerated.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what am I supposed to do when I put
      <a href="http://www.craigslist.org/sfc/eng/124054534.html"
        >a job posting</a
      >
      on Craigslist and get the following response?
    </p>
    <p>
      “My name is XXXX XXXX, and I am a Principal with XXXXX, a venture capital
      firm based in XXXXXXXX. I learned about your startup on Craig’s List. My
      firm manages just north of XXX million in active funds. We invest in
      early-stage software and Internet companies, and I would be interested in
      learning more about your project.”

    <p>You can’t make this stuff up.</p>
    <p>
      Actually, I have to hand it to the guy. One of the three things you need
      to succeed in Venture Capital is proprietary deal-flow (the other two are
      access to capital and good judgement). By hitting Craigslist early, these
      guys are doing legwork that others eschew – they’re hunting for the next
      Skype actively rather then putting their feet up on Mahogany desks and
      waiting for the deals to come pouring in. Welcome!
