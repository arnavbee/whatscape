      Vast.com has launched a new category,
      <a href="http://www.vast.com/v.php?v=home">Credit Cards!</a> Why waste
      your time doing comparison shopping, when you can get what you really
      want, free stuff! Our “deep” crawler now recognizes and extracts credit
      card numbers accidentally posted all across the web, and enables you to
      shop with them. What’s the business model, indeed!

      The <a href="http://www.vast.com/">Vast.com</a> (developer) Preview is
      finally available! If you’ve been wondering what we’ve been up to, here it
      is, in a nutshell – we are building a search service that extracts
      classified ads from across the web, structures them, and then makes them
      available via an open REST API for commercial and non-commercial uses.

      Rich Skrenta dissects why Craigslist is so effective, in a
      <a href="http://blog.topix.net/archives/000095.html">must-read piece</a>.
      Now it’s time to consider exactly effective it is. If the Genie of the
      Market were to offer you all of the future earnings from EBay or
      Craigslist, which would you take? I’d take Craigslist. Note that I’m
      talking about the strengths of the business models here.
