    <p>I wasn’t posting enough on my old blog since:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>SquareSpace is annoying</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>I was writing long, infrequent posts</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I’ll post more frequently on my new WordPress blog – shorter, mor
      wide-ranging topics, and more as notes to self than anything else.
