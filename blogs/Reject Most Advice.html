    <p>Most advice is people giving you their winning lottery ticket numbers</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Nivi:</strong> One of the tweets from the cutting-room floor was:
      “Avoid people who got rich quickly. They’re just giving you their winning
      lottery ticket numbers.”
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Naval:</strong> This is generally true of most advice.
      It&nbsp;goes back to Scott Adams—<a
        href="https://blog.dilbert.com/2013/11/18/goals-vs-systems/"
        >systems not goals</a
      >. If you ask a successful person what worked for them, they often read
      out the exact set of things that worked for them, which might not apply to
      you. They’re just reading you their winning lottery ticket numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s a little glib. There is something to be learned, but you can’t take
      their exact circumstance and map it onto yours. The best founders I know
      read and listen to everyone. But then they ignore everyone&nbsp;and make
      up their own mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      They have their own internal model of how to apply things to their
      situation. And they do not hesitate to discard information. If you survey
      enough people, all of the advice will cancel to zero.
    </p>
    <p>
      You have to have your own point of view. When something is sent&nbsp;your
      way, you&nbsp;have to quickly decide: Is it true? Is it true outside of
      the context of how that person applied it? Is it true in my context? And
      then, Do I want to apply it?
    </p>
    <p>
      You have to reject most advice. But you have to listen to enough of it,
      and read enough of it, to know what to reject and what to accept.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even in this podcast, you should examine everything. If something doesn’t
      feel true to you, put it down. Set it aside. If too many things seem
      untrue, delete this podcast.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Advice offers anecdotes to recall later, when you get your own
        experience</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Nivi:</strong> I think the most dangerous part of taking advice is
      that the person who gave it to you isn’t going to be around to tell you
      when it doesn’t apply any more.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Naval:</strong> I view the purpose of advice a little differently
      than most people. I view it as helping me have anecdotes and maxims that I
      can recall when I have my own direct experience and say, “Ah, that’s what
      that person meant.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Ninety percent&nbsp;of my tweets are maxims that become mental hooks to
      remind me when I’m in that situation again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like, “Oh, I’m the one who tweeted, ‘<a
        href="https://twitter.com/naval/status/511715728899473408?lang=en"
        >If you can’t see yourself working with someone for life, then don’t
        work with them for a day.</a
      >’” As soon as I know I’m not going to be working with someone 10 years
      from now, then I have to start extricating myself from that relationship
      or investing less effort in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I use tweets to compress my own learnings. Your brain space is finite. You
      have finite neurons. You can think of these as pointers, addresses,
      mnemonics to help you remember deep-seated principles where you have the
      underlying experience to back it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you don’t have the underlying experience, then it reads like a
      collection of quotes. It’s cool. It’s inspirational for a moment. Maybe
      you make a nice poster out of it. But then you forget it and move on.
    </p>
    <p>These are compact ways for you to recall your own knowledge.</p>
