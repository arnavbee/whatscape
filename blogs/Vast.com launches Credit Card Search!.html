      Vast.com has launched a new category,
      <a href="http://www.vast.com/v.php?v=home">Credit Cards!</a> Why waste
      your time doing comparison shopping, when you can get what you really
      want, free stuff! Our “deep” crawler now recognizes and extracts credit
      card numbers accidentally posted all across the web, and enables you to
      shop with them. What’s the business model, indeed!
