    <p>The Google / YouTube looks like a win-win all around. Well, almost.</p>
    <p><strong>Google:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Acquire the future of video on the Internet for roughly 1% of your
        market cap.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a
          href="http://www.blogmaverick.com/2006/10/30/some-intimate-details-on-the-google-youtube-deal/"
          >Get $500M in escrow to protect against copyright lawsuits</a
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        These are lawsuits that Google would probably have to defend YouTube
        against anyway, even if Google didn’t own YouTube. Huh? Let’s see,
        YouTube stores and serves up copies of videos without copyright holders’
        advance permission and removes them when removal is requested, under
        DMCA Safe Harbor. Google
        <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/001952.php">copies books</a>,
        and serves up copies of pages without copyright holders’ advance
        permission…
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Youtube and shareholders:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>1 Billion plus reasons to be thrilled</li>
      <li>Uncle Google takes on monetization risk and legal risk</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Major labels:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>$50 Million each</li>
      <li>
        A promise from YouTube that within 6 months, the copyrighted nasties
        will be gone
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Losers:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Small Labels: Don’t have the money or the resources to mount a serious
        legal challenge to Google. Didn’t get paid.
      </li>
      <li>
        Small video-sharing sites: The major labels
        <a
          href="http://www.mp3.com/news/stories/6793.html&amp;ref_id=4930&amp;ref_type_id=1"
          >are going to sue them out of existence to establish a precedent</a
        >, doing the dirty work for Google et al.
      </li>
      <li>
        Artists: Royalties? What royalties? The $50M to each label is structured
        as an equity investment, and not subject to royalty splits.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      So, Google gets the prize, the labels get the money, YouTube gets the
      payout, and Google extends its one-time massive copyright violation to
      build critical mass, while using the labels as enforcers to make sure that
      no one can repeat the YouTube story.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes,
      <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/corporate/tenthings.html"
        >you can make money without being evil.</a
      >
      But for YouTube’s competitors, small labels, and the artists, evil is
      relative.
